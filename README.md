## FAQ

### Where is my previous version?

Is it stored in the `previous_version` directory inside your game directory.

### How does the launcher update my game?

* The launcher downloads the archive for the new version.
* If the `previous_version` subdirectory exists, the launcher moves it in the recycle bin.
* The launcher moves everything from the game directory in the `previous_version` subdirectory.
* The launcher extracts the downloaded archive in the game directory.
* The launcher inspect what is in the `previous_version` directory and it copies the saves, the mods, the tilesets, the soundpacks and a bunch of others useful files from the `previous_version` directory that are missing from the downloaded archive to the real game directory. It will assume that mods that are included in the downloaded archive are the newest and latest version and it will keep those by comparing their unique ident value.

### I think the launcher just deleted my files. What can I do?

The launcher goes to great lengths not to delete any file that could be important to you. With the default and recommended settings, the launcher will always move files instead of deleting them. If you think you lost files during an update, check out the `previous_version` subdirectory. That is where you should be able to find your previous game version. You can also check for files in your recycle bin. Those are the main 2 places where files are moved and where you should be able to find them.

### My antivirus product detected the launcher as a threat. What can I do?

Poor antivirus products are known to detect the launcher as a threat and block its execution or delete the launcher. A simple workaround is to add the launcher binary in your antivirus whitelist or select the action to trust this binary when detected.

If you are paranoid, you can always inspect the source code yourself and build the launcher from the source code. You are still likely to get false positives. There is little productive efforts we can do as software developers with these. We have [a nice building guide](https://github.com/Fris0uman/CDDA-Game-Launcher/blob/master/BUILDING.md) for those who want to build the launcher from the source code.

Many people are dying to know why antivirus products are identifying the launcher as a threat. There has been many wild speculations to try to pinpoint the root cause for this. The best way to find out would be to ask those antivirus product developers. Unfortunatly, they are unlikely to respond for many good reasons. We could also speculate on this for days on end. Our current best speculation is because we use a component called PyInstaller [that is commonly flagged as a threat](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4633). Now, if you want see how deep the rabbit hole goes, you can keep on searching or speculating on why PyInstaller itself is commonly flagged as a threat. This research is left as an exercise to the reader.

Many people are also asking why not simply report the launcher as a false positive to those antivirus products. We welcome anyone who wants to take the time to do it, but we believe it is mostly unproductive. Those processes are often time-consuming and ignored. Someone would also have to do them all over again each time we make a new release or when one of the component we use is updated or changed. The current state of threat detection on PC is quite messy and sad especially for everyone using *free* antivirus products.

### I found an issue with the game itself or I would like to make a suggestion for the game itself. What should I do?

You should [contact the game developpers](https://cataclysmdda.org/#ive-found-a-bug--i-would-like-to-make-a-suggestion-what-should-i-do) about this. We are mainly providing a tool to help with the game. We cannot provide support for the game itself.


### The launcher keeps crashing when I start it. What can I do?

You might need to delete your configs file to work around this issue. That filename is `configs.db` and it is located in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CDDA Game Launcher\`. Some users have reported and encountered unrelated starting issues. In some cases, running a debug version of the launcher to get more logs might help to locate the issue. [Creating an issue about this](https://github.com/Fris0uman/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues) is probably the way to go.


### Will you make a Linux or macOS version?

[TBD]

### It does not work? Can you help me?

Submit your issues [on Github](https://github.com/Fris0uman/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues). Try to [report bugs effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).
